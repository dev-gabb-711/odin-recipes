	<h2>Description</h2>

	<p>
		According to several experts in Asian food history, Filipinos were cooking adobo before Spanish colonization.
		Cooking with <strong>vinegar</strong> preserves meat, <br>
		and is one of the earliest food preservation practices. This is also true of <em>pork adobo</em>, which is
		another popular variation of the dish.
	</p>

	<p>
		While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, <strong>chicken adobo</strong> remains one
		of the most popular and for good reason! <br>
		The taste of <em>juicy chicken</em> in a succulent, umami <strong>adobo sauce</strong> makes chicken adobo a
		comfort food for all ages. <br>
		From kids to adults, we can’t get enough of this <strong>mouthwatering meal</strong>!
